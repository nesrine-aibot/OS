              multi programming : 
we can load multiple programms in the <ram> (respect to hte memory) (we are not descussing the executinon )
              multi taking : 
we can load and execute multiple programs , the consept of parrent and child task
              single tasking : 
we can load and execute only one program at a time 
              multi processing : 
we need to have multiple CPUs in order to achieve this one => multiprogramin multitasking 
              multi Threding : 
execute multiple programs at hte same time (not real contigious programs , time slots ...) => multiprogram , multi tasking


    Discuss the concept of time-sharing systems?
this is the mechanism that alow to achieve the thing we were talking about , way to destribute hte ressources between the tasks
how it works ? 
suppose we have 60 min interval (za3ma) , it will be devided intio 3600 slots ( wich we call it quantum) the tasks will be swaped in that interval  

    Relate the above concepts to the operating system you use everyday?
if we tak windows it is all (multiprogramming , multitasking , multipthreding and multiprocessing )

real time OS: 
example when working with syesm and so on (exaple RTOS) , stuff like train , nuclear stations , airplanes 
task : how can we make  this a real time 
NOTE : the real time must be embedded 

embedded OS: 
computers embedded in another systems , examples : computer embeded in a cars , robots , calculators 
the calculator , its hardware and software are implemetned to have a spesific task 
it will be more effetient but it will serve just in this one devise 
generally they used the microcontroles not the CPU (low in term of performence , costs , less transistors , less circuits , less power)

Mobile OS : 
mobile is a spesific hardware , it has some particularities , even the way we use it 
it is multisking anad so on 

Distributed OS : 
we have deffernet computers , all the computers must have the same os 

Network OS :
not nessessary  all the computers must have the same os, and the computers will be connected throught the network and son on 

Virtualization OS : 
people start thinking about having multiple os in the same machine at the same time , using virtual boxes (VM) , not Dual bot !!
why ? 
becuase in the hardware we can execute multiple OS , why  ? 
because there is a pplication that run just in windows and so on 
another name : HYPERVISOR  
they can connect throuth the network like a two separated machines but hte y are in the same os 


Clustered OS : 
multiple machines  , connected throught the network , the user will see them as a single machine 



                                Exercise 2 (Computer Architecture)


What are the main components of a computer according to the VNA? 
why we care about archi ?
to konw how to link this harwares togheter to achieve the effeciecy of the computation 

memory , cpu I/O linked by 3 tpes of buses : 
control bus : 
data bus : 
address bus : memory address  I/O  devises 
the cpu want to store something in hte memory he send the address throught the address buc and the data throught the data bus , and send the operation in the control bus for example WRITE
