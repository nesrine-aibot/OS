iper threade , Hyperthreding : defind by the system  this is physical the hard program will manage thhis 
multithreding : using time sharring is at the level of the OS 
the constructor to suppport multi concorency 
each core have is own ALU CU
the assambly is a hight level language
the assambly and the compiler are designed regarding the architecture of the computer , and the OS 
clock cycle : inti9al bin 1 et 0 
the cpu is composed of : CU ALU and the clock + registers and cash memory 
the instruction 3ndha architecture , OPcode then operands kol wahda 3anha size ta3ha , the same as thet assembly : operation  / operand 
why there si deffernect version of aasembly : 3la jal size ta3 el instruction li 3ndha 3ala9a bi architecture ta3 our computer
