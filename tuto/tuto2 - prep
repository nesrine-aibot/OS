exo 4 : 
ax = c*a 
XOR ax ax is o , so the instruction div ax will attemp to div 0/0 wich is impossible , so the cpu will raise a software execption intrupt 
and the program will be intrepreted , and the appropriate handler will take its place 

exo5 : 
the value that will be pushed into the stack is the value that in wich thte execution of the program was stoped ,
so it is 0XFBC4 
the cpu it self 
we are reffering to the stack of the process it self wich is pointed by the pointer SS in the registeres 


exo6  :
the code of the intereperet handler since the process is intrupted all the values of the registers will be pushed onto 
its stack and the pc will be apdated to the pc of the intrupt handler wich will use the ax for its own purpuse
